# Pico Reading Time
A simple reading time plugin for Pico. Pico is a stupidly simple, blazing fast, flat file CMS. See https://picocms.org/ for more info.

`PicoReadingTime` allows you to easily add an estimated reading time to your page's content. The plugin is enabled by default, and the time is displayed in minutes. To add the reading time to your page, simply add `{ ReadingTime }` inside your tpl file.

## Install

If you're using one of [Pico's pre-built release packages](https://github.com/picocms/Pico/releases/latest), you need to first create an empty `plugins/PicoReadingTime` directory in Pico's installation directory on your server. Next, download the latest source package of `PicoReadingTime` and upload `PicoReadingTime.php` into the aforementioned `plugins/PicoReadingTime` directory.

That's all.
